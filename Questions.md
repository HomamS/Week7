1. Create a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the sum of the these arguments.

2. Create a function named `colorCar` that receives a color, and prints out, _'a red car'_ for example.

3. Create an object and a function that takes the object as a parameter and prints out all of its properties and values.

4. Create a function named `vehicleType` that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints _'a blue motorbike'_ for example when called as `vehicleType("blue", 2)`

5. Can you write the following without the `if` statement, but with just as a single line with `console.log(...);`?

   ```js
   if (3 === 3) {
     console.log("yes");
   } else {
     console.log("no");
   }
   ```

6. Create a function called `vehicle`, like before, but takes another parameter called `age`, so that `vehicle("blue", 1, 5)` prints _'a blue used car'_

7. Make a list of vehicles, you can add `"motorbike"`, `"caravan"`, `"bike"`, or more.

8. How do you get the third element from that list?

9. Change the function `vehicle` to use the list of question 7. So that `vehicle("green", 3, 1)` prints "a green new bike". 
    > Hint, it should use the `code` to get the value from the list. So `vehicle("green", 2, 1)` prints "a green new caravan".
